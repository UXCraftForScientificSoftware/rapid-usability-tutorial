title: 'Instructor Notes'
---

When delivering this tutorial, it is expected that the instructor will cover all of the content in the main body (not callouts) and the exercises. Some notes have been provided with the exercises to explain solutions or give suggestions to instructors as to how they can discuss participants' responses. Overall, we recommend encouraging people to discuss their expectations and responses; often there are no right or wrong answers and recognizing that context is needed to make choices (e.g. about how many participants to include) is helpful for participants. 

Note that this tutorial content assumes you will present the material over Zoom.
