title: Should you participate?
---

Unsure if this is the lesson for you? We recommend participating if you identify with one or more of the following:

- you are involved in research software development and need to evaluate your designs
- you are unfamiliar with systematic approaches to evaluating user experience
- you want to learn from your users but are uncertain how
- you have never scripted a usability testing session or interview before
- you need concrete examples of how to recruit participants
- you are unsure how to move from a data collection session with participants to insights from that session
