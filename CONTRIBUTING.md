### What and how to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute and we hope you'll get involved:

If you have an idea for substantially modifying the lesson content, the first thing you 
should do is to open an [issue](repo-issues) describing that idea. Lesson episodes were written with specific goals
and strategies in mind. Discussing your change via an issue allows us to ensure your contribution aligns 
with the lesson goals. This isn't meant as a way to filter out contributions, it's a way to make sure your proposed changes
have a strong positive impact. This also means you can contribute ideas without
having to write lesson content yourself (if you don't want to). As a rule, if you want to 
introduce a new idea or exercise to the lesson, you must estimate how
long it will take to teach and explain what you would take out to make room
for it. The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements; the
second, to think hard about priorities.

If you see a small fix that is needed (e.g., addressing a typo or broken link), go ahead 
and make the fix yourself and then open a pull request. If you don't know how to do that, you can 
open an [issue][repo-issues] or [email the maintainers][contact] instead.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome as new issues: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. Reviews from novices and newcomers
are particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these
lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so
fresh eyes are always welcome. That means that if you see an open issue or PR, you should 
feel free to comment on it.

*Note:* If you wish to change the template used for the lesson website, please refer
to [The Workbench documentation][template-doc]. The maintainers of this lesson are not 
responsible for the website template, only the contents.

### Roles and Recognition
A formal governance structure for this lesson is still being established; the procedures 
for decision making and contributing may change. If you have thoughts on this, 
you can share them by [opening an issue][issues]. In the interim, we 
recognize three roles for people working on this project: contributors, maintainers, and creators.

#### Contributors
Contributors are people who have given advice or written content that was incorporated into this lesson. 
People who have presented this tutorial are also considered contributors. You can become a contributor 
by opening an issue or pull request. When your changes are integrated your name will be added to the 
alphabetical list of contributors above.

#### Maintainers
Maintainers fill an important role within this lesson's and the broader STRUDEL community. 
Maintainers are contributors that have a formal responsibility keeping this lesson usable by the community. 
This involves reviewing and integrating contributions. If you reach out about this lesson 
or other STRUDEL projects via Github or email, it is likely you will get a response from one of our maintainers.

Presently, Hannah Cohoon of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's STRUDEL project is the lesson's primary maintainer. 
If you would like to become a maintainer, [open an issue in this repo][issues] indicating as such.
