### Time estimates

The time estimates provided above are very rough estimates. It would be safe to assume the content will take another 30 minutes for a group to work through, though exactly where that time will be spent depends on the content your learners are most familiar with. If you have taught or participated in this lesson and have feedback about timing, please submit an issue or PR. We assume that instructors will not present on callouts or spoilers (i.e. content highlighted in boxes like this one); learners can read those on their own.
