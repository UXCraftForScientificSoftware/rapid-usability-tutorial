## Glossary

**Actionable insight:** An outcome of UXR describing a fingind and and an achievable, concrete step you should take next

**Affinity diagraming:** A qualitative data analysis technique accomplished by clustering related data or ideas together

**Clicks (metric):** Number of clicks participants make when completing a task; a proxy for complexity or efficiency

**Coding:** An aspect of qualitative data analysis, also called labeling, that involves summarizing data in short phrases

**Completion time (metric):** Time taken to complete a task

**Drop-off rate (metric):**  Percentage of participants who stop a task before completing it.

**Efficiency:** An aspect of usability referring to  how quickly they can perform tasks once they've learned the design

**Errors (metric):** Number of mistakes made while attempting a task, possibly broken down by error type

**Idle time (metric):**  Periods of inactivity during a task, indicating confusion or hesitation.

**Informed consent:** Permission granted by a study participant to include them in the research, requiring their complete understanding of the risks and expectations of participating

**Labeling:** An aspect of qualitative data analysis, also called coding, that involves summarizing data in short phrases

**Learnability:** An aspect of usability referring to how easy it is for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design

**Memoing:** A technique for capturing and organizing thoughts during qualitative data analysis involving writing short notes that highlight examples and summarize ideas

**Memorability:** An aspect of usability referring to how easily users can reestablish proficiency after a period of not using a tool 

**Metrics:** The quantitative or qualitative evaluation criteria used to assess user experience and usability

**Quantitative data:** Numerical data

**Qualitative data:** Non-numerical data such as quotes

**Rapid usability testing:** A UXR method to inform development through observatoin of a small number participants carrying out well scoped tasks

**Reverse scoring:** A step in quantitative data analysis needed to invert responses to a negative statement so that a higher score represents a more positive response

**Self-reported ease (metric):**  Participants’ rating of how easy or difficult a task was to complete (e.g., using a Likert scale).

**Self-reported satisfaction (metric):**  Participants’ rating of how satisfied they are with the interface or experience.

**Self-reported usefulness (metric):**  Participants’ rating of how useful the tool or service is.

**Snowball sampling:** A recruitment technique where a potential participant refers the researcher to additional participants

**Successes (metric):** Number of participants who successfully complete a task

**Target population:** The people you want to study

**Task:** The work you assign to a study participant so that you can investigate how usable a tool is

**Think-aloud:** A technique used during participant observation, encouraging them to narrate their thoughts outloud

**Usability:** A multi-faceted concept that generally refers to how easily a person can use a technology or service

**User experience research (UXR):** the investigation of how people interact with, make sense of, and respond to technology and services

**User satisfaction:** An aspect of usability referring to how pleasant it is to use the design and how positive or negative users’ feelings are about the tool

**Utility:** An aspect of usability referring to whether or not the tool enables users to accomplish their goals

**Value proposition:** A statement of benefits that your product offers, distinguishing it from the competition
