# Rapid Usability Testing
This lesson is a five episode training on rapid usability testing. The lesson is intended to be delivered via Zoom and the exercises reflect this, though you can modify the materials for an in person workshop or other delivery format. 

This lesson should teach you to:

- Identify scenarios and tasks appropriate for rapid usability testing
- Recruit for a user study and track participantsâ€™ data
- Conduct and analyze results from a rapid usability assessment

There are no prerequisites for this tutorial.

The time estimates for how long each episode takes are initial estimates that need revision. Take them as a very rough guide.
