### Time estimates

We roughly estimate this content will take a group of learners about 3 hours to work through with an instructor. If you have taught or participated in this lesson and have feedback about timing, please submit an issue or PR. We assume that instructors will not present on callouts or spoilers (i.e. content highlighted in boxes like this one); learners can read those on their own.
